Okay, I don’t actually hate sexy, I’m just not into “sexy” businesses. If I’m rolling into a pitch with a pair of shades saying, this is the “hottest new thing - like sex but with computers”, I’ve done something wrong.

After working for and with many startups, the things I am most interested in are businesses that don’t ooze sex appeal. I like businesses that enable positive changes or facilitate important aspects of our life. 

What do I mean by that? The areas that I am keen on tend to be:
<b>Social impact</b> 
    helping underserved communities ([Obama Foundation](https://www.obama.org/))
    education (edutech, universities)
    
<b>Sustainability</b>
    green products ([Kadeya](https://www.kadeya.com/))
    farming/environment (agritech, natural replacements for plastic)

<b>Operational</b> 
    infrastructure ([CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/), construction firms)
    work tools ([Monday](monday.com), Google Suite)

I want my contribution to society to be fundamental - something that we all use in our lives and never think about.
