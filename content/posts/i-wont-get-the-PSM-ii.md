Hurrah to the PSM I certification! I’m glad I did it. I at least understand the basics and the basis of scrum. I think, in a perfect world, Scrum would be amazing. But it’s not a perfect world. 

Founded in Scrum is a fundamental tenet: the development team is comprised of no more than 10 developers who, altogether, can build the increments of the product. There is no hierarchy. There are no other “titles” for the sake of the work. No architect, no testers, no principals. But that’s fine, because while you may not have the titles, but you still have the abilities.

The idea of it is very pleasant, but it seems to fly in the face of reality. This assumes we are all equal to the task at hand, or at least our abilities are strong enough to support the team. Aside from having to hire a certain level of ability, there is no architect or architecting. Everything is done through collaboration. 

I’m definitely biased by the fact that my partner is an excellent developer and one of his company’s architects. I’ve heard many of his difficulties over the years (i.e. disagreements over how to build a product, discussions that run longer than what might make sense for a 4 week sprint, etc.). I’ve known a number of developers over the years. None of them are of the same level, their opinions vary wildly. 

Even with a Scrum Master providing support to overcome issues, I can’t imagine that you can have disparate teams simultaneously building, architecting, and coordinating while creating a robust product with minimal tech debt. It doesn’t seem reasonable or even fair. With all things, there are great thinkers, great do-ers, and everyone in between. To somehow hire a bunch of devs and tell them to break into teams and focus on launching products as quickly as possible, doesn’t sound balanced or a great long-term solution. 

I guess what it boils down to is that I think there should be hierarchies. I think there are people that should have dedicated roles. I think that having a unified architecture that governs a product is the lesser problematic way to build. Having an architect or even a few architects doesn’t guarantee they are superior or that they are even the best fit for your product, but the democracy of a Scrum framework assumes that all the developers are on a similar level. Me? I like a Republic of the educated and ethical. Maybe that makes me as optimistic as the creators of the Scrum Guide.
