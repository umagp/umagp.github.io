Sorry, but I still call it the Master Bedroom. Anyway…

I passed the PSM I from Scrum.org. And on the first try! It wasn't so much difficult as the lack of discrete experience inside of a dev team that made for the biggest challenge.

The first two startups I worked with were the only ones that had in house dev teams. The first had a team of Eastern European devs because the founder was from there and had his business dealings primarily there. I initially started to help with communications and deck creation, but ended up focused more on the product. 

I didn’t have the vocabulary or the knowledge base back then, but because they were working on couponing, loyalty, etc, I was a subject matter expert.  I love good deals - finding loopholes, exploiting weaknesses (but not too much). In the past, I would consider myself a grey hat of shopping. What I didn’t know then, was that I had an interest in product management. That first startup never launched as the startup that I worked on. At the time it was already a crowded space. Several years later, they realized traction but as a travel service for business people. 

The second startup had a remote dev team. I initially interviewed to do triage for the dev team, but instead, the CEO had me shifted to sales. In the time that I was there, I ended up picking up many different roles between sales, marketing, legal, and at times working as a project manager for new client launches. I learned Jira, Confluence, Hubspot (both marketing and CRM), and Zoho CRM. But never settled into a particular function. 

Since then, I have worked with many startups that were early and outsourced their development. All this is to say, that I had never had any formal training with technical teams, and since Scrum has so much popularity, I did some research and found that the PSM I was what I wanted to try. I bought a course on Udemy, and I’m glad I did. If I hadn’t, I honestly don’t know how many attempts it would take to pass. 

Given my previous experience, I didn’t have some of the fundamental experience that the test is grounded in. While everything is based on the Scrum Guide, a very short document, the test goes into the application of the guide. The Guide outlines the roles of the participants in and around scrum, the structure, and how the participation should come about but there is little specificity of  

But there are few absolutes outside of what everyone should do. There’s very much an emphasis on things on there being rules but not really rules. 

The course went into depth about different scenarios and how the implementation of scrum would be affected by changes whenever things went sideways. Contextualizing made it possible for me to pass the exam and get my PSM I. The question now is, do I try for PSM II? Probably not.
